- Connected via React-Redux Provider

## 🔄 TanStack Query
- Persistent client with localStorage caching
- Query invalidation and background refetching
- Optimistic updates and error handling
- Demo API calls in Home component

## 🧭 React Router
- Client-side routing between Home and About pages
- Navigation component with responsive design

## 🛠️ Available Scripts
- `pnpm dev` - Start development server
- `pnpm build` - Build for production  
- `pnpm preview` - Preview production build
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint

## 🎯 Demo Features

### TanStack Query Features Demonstrated:
- **Persistent Caching**: Data survives page reloads (check Network tab)
- **Loading States**: Beautiful loading indicators with animations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error boundaries and user feedback
- **Background Refetching**: Automatic data updates when stale
- **Query Invalidation**: Mutations trigger related query updates
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI updates during mutations
- **Query Keys**: Smart caching with dependencies (user ID changes)

### Try These Features:
1. **Refresh the page** - Notice data persists from localStorage
2. **Switch between users** - See cached vs fresh data loading
3. **Create a new post** - Mutation invalidates posts query
4. **Open DevTools Network tab** - Observe caching behavior
5. **Go offline** - Cached data still displays

## 🎨 Styling Features
- **Tailwind CSS v4** with modern utilities
- **Responsive design** for mobile and desktop
- **Smooth animations** and hover effects
- **Gradient backgrounds** and modern card layouts
